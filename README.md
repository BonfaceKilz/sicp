# Introduction
This contains snippets of code from Structure and Theory of Computer Programs(SICP). SICP is a masterpiece of Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman on the basics of computer science and software engineering.

My main goal of finishing this book is to be able to understand programming at an intuitive level in addition to providing a way to track my progress in a way that other people can benefit from.

The codes are arranged in chapters

# Tools
I use the in-built *scheme* in Emacs to run all the programs written in the book. When in Emacs, just run `run-scheme` to launch the scheme interpreter.
